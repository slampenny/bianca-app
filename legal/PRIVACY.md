* **Patient/Recipient Information:** If you use the App to initiate calls to another person (e.g., a family member, a patient, a resident - the "Recipient"), you may provide their name and phone number. **You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from the Recipient to provide their information to us and for us to contact them via the App's Services.**
* **Call Data and Content:**
    * **Call Recordings:** Phone calls initiated or managed through the App may be recorded. **Appropriate notice and consent for recording will be sought as required by applicable law before recording begins.**

* **AI Analysis Data:** Results, summaries, or insights generated by AI processing of call recordings and transcriptions.

* **Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including AI transcription services, AI analysis services, data storage, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. These providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect your information.
* **With Your Consent / At Your Direction:** We may share your information (including call data, recordings, transcriptions, summaries) with other users or third parties when you explicitly consent or direct us to do so through the App's functionality (e.g., a family member sharing results, a care facility sharing information according to their policies and resident agreements).
* **Business Transfers:** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
* **Anonymized/Aggregated Data:** We may share anonymized or aggregated data, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for various purposes including research or AI model improvement.

**4. CALL RECORDING AND TRANSCRIPTION CONSENT**

**Recording and transcribing phone calls is subject to laws that vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require consent from all parties on the call.**

* **Our Responsibility:** The App will provide notice mechanisms (e.g., audible announcements at the start of a call) where feasible and legally required, indicating that a call may be recorded and/or transcribed for wellness check purposes.
* **Your Responsibility:**
    * **If you are initiating a call to another person (Recipient):** You are responsible for ensuring that the Recipient has consented to the call being recorded and transcribed by our Service *before* the call proceeds with recording/transcription enabled. You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents required by applicable law.
    * **If you are an organizational user (e.g., retirement home):** You are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents from your residents/patients and/or their legal representatives, in accordance with applicable laws (including privacy and health information laws) and your own policies, before using the App to call and record/transcribe interactions with them. You agree to indemnify us for any failure to obtain such necessary consents.
* **Refusal/Withdrawal:** Participants may have the right to refuse or withdraw consent for recording/transcription according to applicable law.

**5. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information, including sensitive health-related information derived from wellness checks. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

We will retain your personal information, including call recordings and transcriptions, only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
