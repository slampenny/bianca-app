; /etc/asterisk/rtp.conf
; Configuration for RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) media packets

[general]
; Define the starting and ending UDP ports Asterisk will use for RTP media.
; This range MUST match the ports forwarded by Docker and your FRP tunnel.
rtpstart=10000
rtpend=10100

; Other common options (defaults are usually fine unless specific issues arise):
; rtpchecksums=no        ; RTP checksums are rarely used and can consume CPU
; strictrtp=no           ; Allows RTP packets from sources other than the negotiated one (sometimes needed for NAT)
; ice_support=no         ; Enable ICE support (for WebRTC/complex NAT) - requires stun/turn config
; iceserver=...          ; STUN server address if ice_support=yes
; turnserver=...         ; TURN server address if ice_support=yes

; Jitter buffer settings (defaults usually okay, can be tuned per channel)
; jbenable = yes
; jbforce = no
; jbmaxsize = 200
; jbresyncthreshold = 1000
; jbimpl = fixed
; jblog = no
