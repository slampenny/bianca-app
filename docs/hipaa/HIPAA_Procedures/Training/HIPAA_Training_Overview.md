## MODULE 1: HIPAA BASICS (10 minutes)

### What is HIPAA?

**HIPAA** = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)

**Purpose**:
- Protect patient privacy
- Ensure security of health information
- Give patients rights over their health data
- Establish national standards for healthcare

**Who Must Comply?**:
- Healthcare providers (doctors, hospitals, etc.)
- Health plans (insurance companies)
- Healthcare clearinghouses
- **Business Associates** ← This is us!

**What We Do**:
MyPhoneFriend provides communication services for healthcare organizations. We process Protected Health Information (PHI) on behalf of healthcare providers, making us a "Business Associate" under HIPAA.

---

### Why HIPAA Matters

**For Patients**:
- Privacy of sensitive health information
- Control over who sees their data
- Trust in healthcare system

**For Our Company**:
- Legal requirement (not optional)
- Customer trust and contracts
- Avoid massive fines
- Professional reputation

**Penalties for Violations**:
- **Individual**: Up to $250,000 in fines + criminal charges
- **Company**: Up to $1.9 million per violation per year
- **You personally**: Can be held liable for willful neglect

**Real Examples**:
- UCLA Health: $865,000 fine (employees snooping on celebrity records)
- Anthem: $16 million fine (data breach affecting 79 million)
- Individual doctor: 4 months in prison (unauthorized access)

---

### HIPAA Rules

**Privacy Rule** (45 CFR Part 160 and 164):
- Controls use and disclosure of PHI
- Gives patients rights to their data
- Minimum necessary standard

**Security Rule** (45 CFR Part 164.308-312):
- Protects electronic PHI (ePHI)
- Administrative safeguards
- Physical safeguards
- Technical safeguards

**Breach Notification Rule**:
- Notify individuals of breaches
- Report breaches to HHS
- Timeline: 60 days

---

## MODULE 2: PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (15 minutes)

### What is PHI?

**PHI** = Any health information that can be linked to an individual

**18 Identifiers** (must remove to de-identify):
1. Names
2. Geographic subdivisions smaller than state
3. Dates (except year)
4. Phone numbers
5. Fax numbers
6. Email addresses
7. Social Security numbers
8. Medical record numbers
9. Health plan numbers
10. Account numbers
11. Certificate/license numbers
12. Vehicle IDs and serial numbers
13. Device IDs and serial numbers
14. URLs
15. IP addresses
16. Biometric identifiers
17. Full-face photos
18. Any other unique identifying number/characteristic

**Plus**: Any health information (diagnoses, treatments, medications, test results, etc.)

---

### PHI in Our System

**Examples of PHI We Handle**:
- ✅ Patient names, emails, phone numbers
- ✅ Patient addresses and dates of birth
- ✅ Conversation transcripts between patients and AI assistant
- ✅ Medical analysis and sentiment analysis results

**NOT PHI in Our System**:
- ❌ Your employee information (HIPAA doesn't cover employees)
- ❌ Anonymized/de-identified data (once all 18 identifiers removed)
- ❌ System configuration data

---

### How to Handle PHI

**Minimum Necessary Rule**:
Only access the minimum PHI needed to do your job.

**Examples**:
- ✅ GOOD: Customer support accessing patient's contact info to assist
- ❌ BAD: Reading patient conversations out of curiosity
- ✅ GOOD: Reviewing your assigned patients' alerts
- ❌ BAD: Accessing patient records of friends/family

**Golden Rule**: If you don't need it for your job, don't access it.
